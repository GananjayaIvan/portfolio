                        <h5>About</h5>
                        This Project was made as the individual project during the Statistics and Spreadsheet module in RevoU. In this module, we applied what we learned in statistical concepts such as Hypothesis and regression testing, and we used spreadsheet to do our analysis. Our responsibility as a data analyst is to To evaluate the performance, seek insights, for each scenarios based on the data gathered from the 3 campaigns so that we can make more informed business decisions for future campaigns.
                        <br> <br>
                        <h5>Objective</h5>
                        1. Evaluate which campaigns generates the most revenues, has the highest amount of discount and to compare each campaignâ€™s performance to one another.
                        <br> <br>
                        2. To give us an overview of the top 3-5 (Depending on the results) best performing products during the campaign based on revenue generated (Most Profitable) and number of transactions (Most Popular) for each campaign. To check the return of investments (ROI) of each product category.
                        <br> <br>
                        3. By calculating ROI, we can identify which products are the most profitable with each units sold.

                        1. Data Cleaning must be done to ensure that noise data and outliers doesn't affect the results.<br> <br>
                        2. Descriptive Analytics helps us find information about the data such as central tendency (mean, median, mode), dispersion (range, variance, standard deviation), and distribution (skewness, kurtosis). By examining these metrics, analysts can gain a deeper understanding of the dataset's structure and patterns. <br> <br>
                        3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), hypothesis testing, and deriving insights and recommendations are integral stages in the analytical process, each playing a crucial role in extracting meaningful information from data. EDA involves examining the dataset through various graphical and statistical methods to uncover patterns, anomalies, and relationships among variables. It helps analysts understand the data's distribution, outliers, and potential biases, providing a foundation for further investigation. <br> <br>
                        4. Hypothesis testing, on the other hand, is used to validate assumptions or theories about the data. It involves formulating a hypothesis, typically stating a null hypothesis (no effect or relationship) and an alternative hypothesis (some effect or relationship exists), and then using statistical tests to determine the likelihood of the observed results occurring by chance. This rigorous process helps confirm or refute hypotheses, providing statistical evidence to support decision-making. <br> <br>
                        5. Deriving insights and recommendations is the culmination of EDA and hypothesis testing. It involves interpreting the findings in the context of the problem or question at hand, drawing meaningful conclusions, and proposing actionable recommendations based on the data analysis. These recommendations could range from operational improvements to strategic decisions, depending on the insights uncovered during the analytical process. <br> <br>

                        In this stage, we need to make sure the data is clean by removing rows and columns missing and duplicate data, changing the data into appropiate type, imputing missing data, and adding new KPI for analysis.
