                        <h5>About</h5>
                        This Project was made as the individual project during the Python module in RevoU. In this module, we applied what we learned with Python and what it can do in data analysis, visualization, and an application of machine learning. As a data analyst, we can evaluate the customer's value based on a few metrics. <br> <br>

                        <h5>Objective</h5>
                        Today's date is January 31, 2023, and you're a data analyst at RevoBank, a bank based in Europe. You're currently working with the Performance Management (PM) team, whose goal is to encourage existing customers to use RevoBank credit card products more. <br>
                        You've received a data summary from the MIS (Management Information System) team, detailing clients and their sales over the last three years (36 months). Your manager has tasked you with summarizing the sales performance from the past three years and creating user personas based on the existing clients. <br> <br>
                        
                        <h5>Steps to take & Considerations</h5>
                        The goal of this analysis is to understand patterns and trends of customer segmentations, create actionable insights, and identify business opportunities to optimize performance and decision-making. <br> <br>

                          1. Data Cleaning must be done to ensure that noise data and outliers doesn't affect the results in a significant way.<br> <br>
                          2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), hypothesis testing, and deriving insights and recommendations are integral stages in the analytical process, each playing a crucial role in extracting meaningful information from data. EDA involves examining the dataset through various graphical and statistical methods to uncover patterns, anomalies, and relationships among variables. It helps analysts understand the data's distribution, outliers, and potential biases, providing a foundation for further investigation. <br> <br>
                          3. Customer segmentation allows us to segment customers based on their value, age, background, etc <br> <br>
                          4. Cluster interpertation allows us to fully understand each clusters based on their Characteristics. <br> <br>
                          5. Deriving insights and recommendations is the culmination of EDA and hypothesis testing. It involves interpreting the findings in the context of the problem or question at hand, drawing meaningful conclusions, and proposing actionable recommendations based on the data analysis. These recommendations could range from operational improvements to strategic decisions, depending on the insights uncovered during the analytical process. <br> <br>
